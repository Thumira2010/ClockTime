## ⚙️ How It Works

1. When the page loads, the site checks the current time and sets the theme (morning or night).
2. You can manually toggle themes using the "Toggle Theme" button.
3. The theme toggle updates the UI with a sun or moon icon.
4. Time updates every second, and 12/24-hour format can be switched with a button.
5. Night mode includes animated star effects for visual appeal.
